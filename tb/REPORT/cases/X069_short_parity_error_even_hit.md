# ✅ X069_short_parity_error_even_hit

**Bucket:** `ERROR` &nbsp; **Method:** `F` &nbsp; **Build:** `CFG_A` &nbsp; **Effort:** `practical` &nbsp; **Result:** `pass`

## Intent

- **Scenario:** Assert parity error on even short hit
- **Primary checks:** emitted hit has `error(0)=1`
- **Contract anchor:** hit-error latch

## Execution Evidence

<!-- fields (chief-architect legend)
  status                       = this case's overall health (legend: ✅ pass / ⚠️ partial / ❌ fail / ❓ pending)
  method                       = D = directed (1 txn); R = randomised (N txns)
  observed_txn                 = number of scoreboard-observed transactions driven by this case
  standalone_coverage          = code coverage measured from this case's own isolated UCDB
  isolated_cov_per_txn         = standalone_coverage averaged over observed_txn (useful for random cases)
  bucket_gain_by_case          = incremental code coverage this case added to the bucket's ordered merge
  bucket_merged_total_after    = the bucket's merged code coverage after this case was merged
  bucket_gain_per_txn          = bucket_gain_by_case averaged over observed_txn
